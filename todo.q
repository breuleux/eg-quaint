== TODO

* Give `[[]] and `{} lower priority than indent.
* `[blah::[xy]z] should have `[[xy]] as the right hand side and not
  `[[xy]z].
* Engine.run -> Engine.gen, Engine.run{src, documents}
* Apply regular expressions to contiguous strings
* `genfor multiple documents at the same time
* specify document generation order
* plugin system

* MAYBE: suffix `[!] and `[?] behave like suffix `[.]. Also `[...],
  `[?!?] and so on.
